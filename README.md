# group-b-project


This was a group project to redesign and develop three web pages from my school. There were four people per group.
Our goal was to work together on seperate branches and then reconvene and merge to the main branch and deploy on Vercel. 

First we would discuss the assignment as a group and delegate tasks and roles.
FIGMA was used to create markups
We would then draw and sketch wireframes and storyboards.
Visual Studio Code- was used as the text editor
From there we begin coding with HTML, CSS (tailwind-2.2v), and, JavaScript.
Learning how to use tailwindcss was no small task. The abreviations and other nuances slowly became second nature as the project moved forward

The flow of commits, merge, checkout, and more was also a learning process.

The assignment was delpoyed on Vercel.
